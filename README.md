# 🌊🚀 **HydroNav – Tactical Navigation Pipeline**

> **Mission Objective:** Provide intelligent, flood-aware navigation using real-time data, adaptive routing, and a futuristic HUD experience.

---

## 🟢 **1. System Boot & Calibration**

✨ The application initializes a **futuristic HUD interface**, locks onto a **GPS signal**, and applies a **Low-Pass Filter** to stabilize the vehicle’s positional data, ensuring smooth and accurate navigation from the very start.

---

## 🎯 **2. Target Acquisition**

🗺️ The user selects a destination. HydroNav instantly fetches **real-time map data** along with the latest **flood topography**, building a situationally aware navigation model.

---

## ⚠️ **3. Threat Analysis**

🔍 A **Ray Casting algorithm** is executed to determine whether the direct route polyline intersects with any **active flood polygons** (hazard zones).

---

## 🧭 **4. Adaptive Detour**

🛠️ If a threat is detected, the routing engine dynamically generates **perpendicular detour waypoints**, calculating the safest possible alternative paths around the flood hazard.

---

## 🕶️ **5. Tactical HUD Deployment**

🎮 Once navigation begins, the map transitions into a **3D cockpit-style perspective**, displaying:

* 🚗 Real-time speed
* ⏱️ Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
* 🔊 Turn-by-turn **voice-guided navigation**

---

## 🔄 **6. Live Mitigation**

🌐 While driving, HydroNav continuously **re-scans the environment**. If a new flood zone emerges mid-route, the system triggers an **automatic real-time reroute**, ensuring uninterrupted safety.

---

## 🧠 **Core Capabilities at a Glance**

✅ Real-time flood detection
✅ Intelligent hazard avoidance
✅ Continuous live rerouting
✅ Immersive 3D HUD experience

---

> 🛡️ **HydroNav doesn’t just navigate — it anticipates, adapts, and protects.**
